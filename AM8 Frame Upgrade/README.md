## Frame
[AM8 Frame](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2263216): use for aluminum cut dimensions and printed frame support parts

## Printed Parts
Parts are borrowed from the [Prusa Bear Upgrade](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade) and [Prusa Bear Extruder and X Axis](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis)
The AM8 2040 extrusion profile is different from the Prusa Bear 2040 extrusion profile so parts that connect to the 2040 profiles have been modified.
